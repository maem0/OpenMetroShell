# OpenMetroShell
 Charms Bar, Start Screen, and other Metro elements in Electron for windows 10/11.

# Metro style apps
to install metro style tiles (not working yet, too lazy to actually setup so its just visual), go to "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs", download this: https://files.catbox.moe/qb26q4.zip, and put the "metroapps" folder in the programs folder, you can make your own aswell, the folder auto detects folders
